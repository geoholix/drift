###Find you place, along the way...
Have you ever been on a long drive and needed a cup of coffee? Or maybe you want to plan a stop in a few hours and want to know where you will be? You don't want to start exiting the freeway randomly and you don't want to find something thats out of your way.

You need to find your place along your way, you need to **Drift!**
